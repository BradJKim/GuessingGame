# Guessing Game

This is a beginner level project intended to introduce how to create coding projects and to navigate around using files as well as github, and aquainting the programmer with terminal commands and locating files. The guessing game is a template for learning how to implement bigger projects and ideas in a more profession perspective in the form of files rather than other coding interfaces.
